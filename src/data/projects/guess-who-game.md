### Motivation
I decided to work on this game after realizing the classic version was quite biased, with only 5 women out of 20 cards and all the characters having almost identical skin tones. I illustrated the characters because I truly believe play is an important part of education, and I wanted players to have access to more diverse (and real) world representations. So, when I graduated from bootcamp, I saw the perfect opportunity to put my illustrations to use.

In the end, it turned out to be a great learning tool for kids and foreign language learners.

### Details and Main Features
The game involves guessing a random character by asking questions about their visible features. 

- Choose an avatar
- Choose easy or hard mode, wiht a maximum number of questions and attempts allowed
- Turn sound effects on or off
- Compose any question by combining one or two inputs
- Discard cards by simply clicking on them
- Get a detailed view of a character
- Know how long it took them to solve the guess

### Development, Challenges and Learnings
As my first self-guided project, it presented several challenges and learning opportunities.

I expanded my knowledge of React functional components and hooks, and became comfortable installing and using various packages and libraries.

I also took charge of designing the entire interface, choosing a color palette that complements the tones of the illustrations:

One of the most significant challenges was displaying a lot of picture cards on the screen to show all the characters. I learned about CSS Flexbox and used it to adapt the cards to different screen sizes.

To maximize the use of available space, I took advantage of toggleable panels and modular components that can be shown or hidden as needed by users. I also customized Material UI components to fit my needs and match the color palette, ensuring it complemented the tones of the illustrations.
