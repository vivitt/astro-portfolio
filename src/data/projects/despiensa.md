A smart shopping list app that learns users' buying habits and helps them remember what they are likely to need to buy on their next trip to the store.

[Live demo](https://www.despiensa.site/)

### Motivation
[The Collab Lab](https://the-collab-lab.codes/) supports early-career developers by providing an environment to gain practical experience through remote collaboration on real-world projects as part of an agile team.

This project is the result of the TCL-71 participation and was developed by [Celine](https://github.com/ocsiddisco), [Borja](https://github.com/borjaMarti), [Judith](https://github.com/BikeMouse), and [Viviana](https://github.com/vivitt).

We worked on this application from February to early April 2024, using React, Tailwind, and Firebase, with Figma employed to create our app's views.

### Details and Main Features
The game involves guessing a random character by asking questions about their visible features. 

- Choose an avatar
- Choose easy or hard mode, wiht a maximum number of questions and attempts allowed
- Turn sound effects on or off
- Compose any question by combining one or two inputs
- Discard cards by simply clicking on them
- Get a detailed view of a character
- Know how long it took them to solve the guess

### Development, Challenges and Learnings
As my first self-guided project, it presented several challenges and learning opportunities.

I expanded my knowledge of React functional components and hooks, and became comfortable installing and using various packages and libraries.

I also took charge of designing the entire interface, choosing a color palette that complements the tones of the illustrations:

One of the most significant challenges was displaying a lot of picture cards on the screen to show all the characters. I learned about CSS Flexbox and used it to adapt the cards to different screen sizes.

To maximize the use of available space, I took advantage of toggleable panels and modular components that can be shown or hidden as needed by users. I also customized Material UI components to fit my needs and match the color palette, ensuring it complemented the tones of the illustrations.
