## Tech Stack
This project was built using React for the frontend and Firebase for user authentication and data storage. During the final phase, we integrated Tailwind as the CSS framework to style the app. I also contributed to the app's user interface design using Figma.

## Details and Main Features
This is a fully responsive web app that allows users to create lists and prioritize items based on their likelihood of needing them again. The app also enables users to share their lists with others.

Main features include:

- User login

- Create lists

- Add items to lists

- Search for items

- Share lists with other registered users


## Motivation
[The Collab Lab](https://the-collab-lab.codes/) supports early-career developers by offering an environment for gaining practical experience through remote collaboration on real-world projects as part of an agile team.

This project is the outcome of our participation in TCL-71, developed by [Celine](https://github.com/ocsiddisco), [Borja](https://github.com/borjaMarti), [Judith](https://github.com/BikeMouse), and [Viviana](https://github.com/vivitt).

We worked on this application from February to April 2024.
