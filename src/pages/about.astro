            I am Viviana, a creative web developer with a background in
            audiovisual & visual communication.
          </p>
          <p>
            I care about crafting inclusive, accessible, and beautiful web
            experiences with a user-centric approach.
          </p>
          <p>
            Passionate about coding and the web platform, I love the
            intersection between design and engineering and my interests also
            include technical writing, open source, illustration, films &
            photography, knowledge sharing, and everything in between.
          </p>
          <p>
            While a big part of my life happens on the screen, I am also an
            offline crafter and a keen reader.

            I wrote my first lines of code while working as a 2D character
            animator and loved it. First learned HTML and CSS and eventially
            decided to fully transition my career into software development.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thanks to my background, I grew as a collaborative team player, used
            to taking ownership of my work while working within a team towards a
            common goal.
          </p>
          <p>
            I deeply care about what I create, but I learned early in my career
            not to get too attached to a piece of work and to stay open to
            changes. Adapting quickly to new environments and tasks is one of my
            strengths.

      <h2>Breaking Into Tech</h2>
      <p>
        After graduating from a bootcamp in the MERN stack, I completed a
        software engineering internship at the Wikimedia Foundation, where I
        worked on a project I worked on a project oriented towards increasing
        the adoption of Vue.js and Wikimedia Design System Codex on Wikipedia's
        frontend. I refactored and tested several Object-Oriented JavaScript
        user interfaces and published the blog post <a
          href="https://diff.wikimedia.org/2023/06/13/how-to-create-your-own-reusable-dialog-with-codex/"
          target="_blank">How to create your own reusable dialog with Codex</a
        >. See here <a
          href="https://github.com/wikimedia/mediawiki-extensions-GrowthExperiments/commits?author=vivitt"

        > or <a href="/cv/Viviana_Yanez-frontend_developer.pdf" target="_blank"
          >download my CV</a
        >.
      </p>

      <p>
        I also participated in <a
          href="https://the-collab-lab.codes/"
          target="_blank">The Collab Lab</a
        > as a frontend developer, where I worked on a smaller project using React
        and Firebase with an amazing team of developers and mentors. It was a great
        opportunity to take on a lot of ownership over the team planning and design.

      <h2>What I'm Working On</h2>
      <p>
        Until now, I’ve mostly focused on frontend tools and frameworks but I’m
        always eager to explore new stacks.
      </p><p>
        I’m comfortable coding with JavaScript and TypeScript, and have used
        React, Vue, Astro and Next.js. I really enjoy writing CSS, both with and
        without preprocessors. Recently, I’ve spent time learning about web
        security and web fundamentals.

        socials. I’m always happy to exchange experiences, learnings, and
        thoughts.
